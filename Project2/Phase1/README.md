### The project requires to write test programs to exercise different twitter APIs such as retrieving tweets, user information, hashtags. The twitterPhase1.py script is able to find public tweets posted by a specific user, and tweets with specific hashtags. The output retrieved from Twitter is saved in the output text files.

The project is fully implemented in twitterPhase1.py, and there are three output files can be obtained: tweetsHashTagOutput.csv, tweetsUserOutput.csv and tweetsOutput.csv.
