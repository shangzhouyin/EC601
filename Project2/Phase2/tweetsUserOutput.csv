5,veritasium,@devinbarney11 All good. This is a popular topic and I know a lot of people are into it. It‚Äôs important to know!
6,veritasium,@devinbarney11 I‚Äôm not aware of that book or author. Inspirations are mainly Kahneman and Ericsson and others cited

10,veritasium,@1ine4r @Jawad_Dheini @LCTTA @MBurnsKaurin The ions are mobile so if you bring something positive close by the negatives will move closer to it. If you bring something negative nearby the positives move closer to it.
11,veritasium,@Jawad_Dheini @LCTTA @MBurnsKaurin Right. Pure water contains ions: H+ and OH-
12,veritasium,"@MBurnsKaurin @LCTTA It is electric but not the electric dipole of water.

21,veritasium,@Robin_B Was great to meet you and see your art!
22,veritasium,@christos_markou I can upload an .srt file if you email it to me‚Ä¶
23,veritasium,@Tauss_srgl Me too! I built 10 ft supporting structures to isolate the circuit
24,veritasium,@linusgsebastian @Dropbox Yes please!
25,veritasium,@TheDukeInPurple @Dropbox But apparently it doesn‚Äôt just do that if you transfer in with more than 4TB which seems dumb. The starting limit should be at least 5 TB since they know that‚Äôs what you came from
26,veritasium,@brettrann @Dropbox I don‚Äôt understand who made this decision And why it hasn‚Äôt been fixed yet
27,veritasium,@TheDukeInPurple @Dropbox The second support guy I talked to explained it like this. The first told me to call anytime I needed more space ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
28,veritasium,"That‚Äôs right, with @Dropbox you pay more money and get less storage, by default.

Dropbox declined to offer any compensation for their idiotic business practice or the inconvenience it caused.

So anyone got good cloud storage recommendations?"
29,veritasium,"The @dropbox support guy confirmed that when you upgrade from the Standard 5 TB storage plan to the Advanced ‚Äòas much storage as needed‚Äô plan, the new default storage is 4 TB.

If you want more storage you have to call them and request it. ü§Ø"
